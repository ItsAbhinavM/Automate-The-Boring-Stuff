# PRACTICE QUESTIONS


1. There are two types of Boolean datatypes True and False . It can be used in some conditions in the loop ( while True ) ,arithmetic computations and logical conparisons .
2. The three boolean operators 'are' , 'and' and  'in' 
3. A truth table shows every possible result of a Boolean operator.
True and True 

True

True and False 

False

False and False 

False

False

True or True

True

True or False

True

False or True

True

False or False

False

not True

False

not not not not True

True

4. False
False
True
False
False
True

5.The six comparison operators are >,<,=,==,>=,<=

6.The equal to operator gives the value to the other variable whereas the assignment operators such as == checks whether the variables/operators given at the sides are equal or not .

7. A condition is the statement that we are giving in a loop . It can be used manily in loop such as if,elif, while etc.

8.The number of blocks in this code is 4 , since the indentation of the code changed four times .

9.
``` 
spam=1
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings .")
```

10.ctlr+c which inturns break the code

11.The break statement breaks the loop whereas the continue statement skips the remaining part of the loop and returs back to the condition of the  loop again.

12.range(10) :  prints the number from 0 to 9
range(0,10) : prints the number from 0 to 9
range(0,10,1) : prints the number from 0 to 9 with step 1

13.
```
#using for loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
#using while loop

a=1
while a!=11:
    print(a)
    a+=1```
14. from spam import bacon

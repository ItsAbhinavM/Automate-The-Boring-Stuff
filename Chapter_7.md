# PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. The functio nre.compile creates the regex objects
2. Because they allow you to give more specifactions for the search like putting / ,etc
3. The search method returns the matching setence from the selected phrase .
4. By using the group method
5. It returns the completely matching string .
6. It can be be done by using / or () .
7. If the result have two or more values then it will return a list of tuples .
8. It means 'either or'
9. ? is mainly used for non-greedy mode and in some parts it is meant to “match zero or one of the preceding group” .
10. + is used if there is one or more values , is there could be zero or more values then we could use * .
11. The {3} is used for getting exactly 3 values and {3,5} is used to get anywhee between 3 to 5 values .
12. /d means the integer values between 0-9 , /s means space and /w means word .
13. The /D , /S and /W means to identify all other values apart from an integer a word and space .
14. The .* is a greedy mode and .*? is a non-greedy mode .
15. srch=re.compile([0-9a-z])
16. By usign re.IGNORECASE() function .
17. The . is used to match all other values other than a newline . if re.DOTALL is passed on the re.compile() then it will consider the newline characters too .
18. The sub method is used to return a string with the substitutions applied . So it will return 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens' .
19. The re.verbose() allows you to use whitespaces and comments in the code which makes it easier to read .
20. rn=re.compile(r'\d{1,3}(,d{3})$')
21. s=r.compiler(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\s')
22. rp=re.comiler(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseball)',re.IGNORECASE)

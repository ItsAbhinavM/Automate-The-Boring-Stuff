# PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. No the PyInputPlus library does not come with the standard directories that python has , we need to specifiaclly import it in the code inorder to use it .
2. It can be used since the name PyInputPlus is very lenghty to type .
3. The function inputInt() allows the user to type only integer and the function inputfloat allows the user to type only float dataype values .
4. By using the min and max functions of the pyinput library in the code it is possible to perform such task.

   pyip.inputint(min=0,max=99)
5. The values that we need to either allow or deny from the input can be given in the allow and block regexes of pyinputplus
6. It will raise an RetryLimitException error in the code .
7. It will return hello .
